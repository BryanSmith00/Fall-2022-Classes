# 4353 Software Design Week 04 Videos Part 1 Influences of TDD on Agility and Sustainability

TDD - Test Driven Development

Agile - Feedback loop allows you to build relevant working software

Feedback circles
- Code is meeting your expectations (programmer)
- Code is meeting customer's expectations (relevance circle)

TDD has costs, it increases the time and cost of development but decreases the cost of maintenance

it requires learning, as well as unlearning, 

TDD works best with tactical design

Manual testing is still certainly required


Automated testing means verification 



## Types of testing

White-box testing
- unit testing
- looks at implementation

Black-box testing
- Doesnt care about details of implementation
- Functional and acceptance testing



Unit testing

unit - smallest section of code that does 

Tests classes/models/...


UI level testing is dangerous and brittle

Pyramid structure is better than ice cream cone
- More lower level testing
