# 4353 Software Design Week 02 Videos Part 1 Thinking about Abstraction

A pure abstraction has only the minimum essentials details
- Doesnt represent a real world object. Represents our perception of the object within the context of the problem

abstraction depends on the domain that it is in. A car abstracted to a designer would be different than to a consumer

domain: medical field, financial field
- high level view of the abstraction, what is relevant in this field or domain

context - more specific than domain, what pieces of the domain are you interested in

bounded contexts - most specific, are there certain ranges of values that lend themselves to abstraction
- in bounded context you can exclude certain ranges of data

Domain drive design (book) - Abstraction design should be driven by your domain
