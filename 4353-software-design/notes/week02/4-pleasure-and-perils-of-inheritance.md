# 4353 Software Design Week 02 Videos Part 4 Pleasure and Perils of Inheritance

Relationships between abstractions

Association

Aggregation - more closely related than associated

is-a or kind-of relationships

Inheritance 
- if two things are in a "is-a" or "kind of" relationship then it could be inheritance<br>
ex. hatchback is a car, car is a kind of vehicle

Inheritance increases reusability but also increases coupling, double-edged sword

Inheriting from a class is a high level of coupling because it is now bound to that implementation

## Interface inheritance

interface inheritance is much better than implementation inheritance

leads to looser coupling
