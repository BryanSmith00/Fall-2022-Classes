# 4353 Software Design Week 01 Videos Part 1 Designing Software

Designs should be easy to change, easy to understand, easy to maintain, cheaper in cost<br>

Languages strongly impact the design

## User stories (features to implement)

Value - assign stories values for priority<br>
Impact - How much would this story impact your architecture<br>

- stories of the same value? implement the one with higher impact and vice versa<br>

### Why is it hard to develop software
- Relevance: time is spent on unneeded features
- Maintainability: Are you able to understand what is already there and make non breaking changes

    * The more maintainable software is the more time is spent on maintenence but it is time well spent

1. Who is using the software? how are their wants and needs as users different from yours as a designer

2. Who Pays for it? The cost of bugs and revising designs

Keep designs simple, easy to understand and fails gracefully
