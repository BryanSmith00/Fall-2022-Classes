Interaction diagram

Sequence diagram

## What to show

only the essential details

# Objects are nouns (mostly) (person, coaster, truck)

methods are verbs 


Singleton
- object that only has a single instance or very few


abstract class 
- zero instances, used for extension later

interaction diagram is an object diagram

## object diagrams

show objects and relationships between objects

lightweight, minimum, essential

Attributes - data values within a class

Don't show internal identifiers like ID (things that everything has)

Don't show all attributes

private fields have a - in front public a +

derived attributes are computed from base attributes

polymorphic method - implementation varies based on the type of object

helper methods - private but help other methods in the class

mutators - modify state of an object
