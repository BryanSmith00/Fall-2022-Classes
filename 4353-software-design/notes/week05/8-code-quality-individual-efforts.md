# 4353 Software Design Week 05 Videos Part 8 Code Quality: Individual Efforts

care about design

- good variable names (no single letters, descriptive names)
- domain specific variable names (good)
- short methods (focus on a single level of abstraction, not necessarily small in size)
- smaller classes
- learn by reading good code

kiss - keep it simple stupid

automated tests with high coverage

- ensure the code that once worked continues to work through all changes
- untested code is unfinished code

run tests before checkin (tests should pass)

avoid cargo cult - understand why practices are used before using them yourself

court feedback and criticism

- ask for feedback from others and be open to improvement

checkin frequently
