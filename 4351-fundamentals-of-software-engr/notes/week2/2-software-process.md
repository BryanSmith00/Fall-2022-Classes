# COSC 4351 Software Engineering lecture 2

## Software development life cycle (SDLC)

1. Initiation

2. System concept development - Defines the scope of concept, includes boundry document, cost benefit analysis

3. Planning - Develop a project management plan and other documents

4. Requirement analysis - Analyzes user needs and develops user requirements. Create a detailed functional requirements document

5. Design - Transforms detailed requirements into complete detailed system design document focuses on how to deliver the required functionality

6. Development - Converts design documents into complete detailed systems

7. Integration and test - demonstrates that developed system conforms to requirements as specified in the functional requirements document

8. Implementation

9. Operations & maintenance - Operate and maintain information systems in a production environment, includes post-implementation and In-process reviews

10. Disposition - end-of-system activities, emphasis is given to proper preparation of data

## Software process model 

A structured set of activities required to develop a software system

## Process Patterns

Describes a process related problem that is encountered during software engineering work

Identifies the environment in which the problem has been encountered and suggests one or more proven solutions to the problem 

- A process pattern provides you with a template and a consistent method for describing problem solutions within the context of the software process

### types

Stage patterns
- Defines a problem associated with a framework activity for the process

Task patterns
- Defines a problem associated with a software engineering action or work task

Phase pattern
- Define a sequence of framework activities that occur with the process even when the overall flow of the activities is iterative in nature

## Software development models

Prescriptive models - traditional (waterfall)

Agile models - modern (agile)
