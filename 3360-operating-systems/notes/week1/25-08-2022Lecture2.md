# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 2

## Accumulator(AC or ACC) - temporary storage register

### Instruction execution
1. Processor reads instructions from memory
2. Processor executes instruction
3. Back to fetch stage<br></br>

### Instruction registers (types of instructions)
- Processor-memory (ex. fetching instructions or data from memory)
- Processor-IO (slow)
- Data processing
- Control (if, for, etc.)<br></br>

## Hypothetical computer systems

Size of memory position = size of instruction register = size of data<br>
- The sizes of these in bits determines the base you need to use to represent it (hex, octal, etc.)

Number of different instructions you can have = 2<sup>(size of opcode in bits)</sup>

Size of memory (bytes) = # of positions * size of position<br>
Number of positions = 2<sup>(size of address in bits)</sup>

Memory range: 000 - FFF<br>
Data range: 0000 - FFFF<br></br>
