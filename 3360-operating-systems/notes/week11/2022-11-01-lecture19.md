# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 19 Unit 3 Memory management

programming assignment 3

- only one file no server
- child threads must print in order
- only when printing should we synchronize the code using critical sections
- assign thread number to each thread
- start turn at 0 and increase, print according to thread number
- no array of arguments for passing to threads
- in child thread copy contents of arguments into local variable then change the arguments to the next needed one in main
- use critical section or semaphores to ensure that the child has copied the arguments before changing their value
- when the parent calls create wait on a semaphore and then once the arg has been copied by child, signal the semaphore
- no globals
- pass semaphores and condition variables to child threads by reference
- copy paste programming assignment 1
- copy input processing from assign 2

## chapter 7 memory management

frame - fixed length block of memory

page - fixed length block of data that resides in secondary memory such as disk

segment - a variable length block of data that resides in secondary memory

relocation - swapping processes in and out of memory as needed

### fixed partitioning

#### equal-size partitions

any process whose size is lass than or equal to the partition size can be loaded into an available partition

inefficient, cant run large programs, small programs waste space

#### unequal size partitions

better than equal size but still limited

### dynamic partitioning

partitions of variable length and number

from time to time you need to compact the partitions to avoid holes inbetween processes (external fragmentation)

best-fit algorithm - chooses the block closest in size to the needed size

- takes more time because it checks all partitions to find the best
- causes external fragmentation

first-fit - chooses the first availble partition that will fit the process

- faster because you dont need to access all memory partitions

next-fit - uses the most recently allocated block and starts searching for first block from there

### buddy system

compromise of fixed and dynamic partitioning

(kind of like merge sort, break the memory down into halfs until you find a fixed partition to fit)

- leads to internal fragmentation (empty space in the partition due to fixed partition size)

when processes are released if the left and right halves are avaliable, merge them back together

### addresses

#### logical

location of the page plus the offset to that page

#### relative

address is expressed as a location relative to some known point

#### physical or absolute

actual location in main memory

### paging

partition memory into fixed-length blocks called frames

pages get assigned into frames of main memory

pages and frames must be of the same size

each process maintains a page table (contains the frame location for each page in the process)
