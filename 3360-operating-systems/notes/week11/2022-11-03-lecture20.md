# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 20 Memory management contd

programming assignment 3

- need 2 mutex semaphores, one for copying the structure into the child thread and one for synchronizing the output
- use a single structure for arguments and just change the values for each thread

paging - divide process into pages that are stored in memory frames

## memory management

### logical addresses

a program can be subdivided into segments

segmentation has a higher overhead than paging but only assigns memory that is needed

addresses need to be translated from paged addresses to physical or logical addresses

### security issues

buffer overflow attacks

reads data from beyond the allowed memory (bad)

## virtual memory

extra memory storage on secondary media like hard drive

resident set - portion of the process in main memory

an interrupt is generated when an address is needed that is not in main memory

operating system places the process in a blocking state

virtual paging and virtual segmentation

### principle of locality

when getting words from virtual memory, bring a block of nearby words to decrease chance of having to revisit disk

this avoids thrashing

- hardware support needed for virtual memory

using virtual memory increases the size of the page table in memory (problem)

hierarchical page table (solution)

inverted page table (another solution)

### translation lookaside buffer (tlb) (hardware)

each virtual memory reference can cause 2 memory accesses, one for the page table, one for the data

tlb - cache buffer for some recently used page tables

if the page youre looking for is in the tlb you can immediately get the physical memory address

smaller pages means more memory used for page tables. larger pages leads to internal fragmentation

segmentation is visible to the programmer, paging is not

### policies for virtual memory

#### fetch policy

demand paging - only bring the page you need

prepaging - bring other pages to increase chances of multiple hits

### placement policy

determines where in main meory a process piece is to reside (important for segmentation)

key for NUMA systems. multiple processor systems each processor has a bank of memory

### replacement policy

deals with the selection of a page in main memory to be replaced when a new page is needed

#### frame locking

when a frame is locked the page stored in it cannot be replaced

used for kernel of the os and important memory

#### optimal replacement policy

selects the page for which the time to the next reference is the longest (requires knowing the future)

used as a benchmark not as actual implementation

produces a fault when a page replaces another
