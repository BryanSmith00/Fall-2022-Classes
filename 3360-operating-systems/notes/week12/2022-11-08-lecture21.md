# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 21 Memory management contd

each thread gets a thread number and you print according to that order. watch video explaining programming questions from exam 2

list of probabilities (pass by reference), index (same as index used for thread number)

defer the calculation of the cdf into the child thread

thread number pass by value, copy into local variable to thread before changing it in main

2 mutex semaphores and a condition variable

define turn in main, pass a pointer to turn to each child thread

## page replacement contd

fault occurs whenever you replace a page with another page (getting pages into empy frames are not considered faults)

### optimal

impossible to implement looks into the future to replace the page that will not be needed for the longest

### lru (least recently used)

replaces the page that had not been referenced for the longest time

difficult to implement, lots of overhead to tag each page

### fifo (first in first out)

treats page frames allocated to a process as a circular buffer

pages are removed in a round-robin style

only need to maintain a pointer to the oldest frame and update it whenever that frame is replaced

less efficient than lru but very simple complexity

### clock policy

requires the association of an additional bit with each frame referred to as the use bit

when a page is loaded into a frame or referenced, the bit is set to 1

the set of frames is considered to be a circular buffer

tries to find the first page in memory with a use bit equal to 0

uses a pointer to break the infinite loop

everyime you place or replace a page you advance the pointer by 1

if all pages have a use bit 1 then flip the bit to 0 and advance the pointer until you get to a page with 0

used as a lighter-weight version of lru

can extend the algorithm to take into account page modifications

## replacement efficiency

1. optimal
2. lru
3. clock (almost as good as lru once you have many frames)
4. fifo

## page buffering

improves paging performance and allows the use of a simpler page replacement policy

a replaced page is not lost but assigned to a list, free page list or modified page list

then free page list frames are available for reading back into memory quickly

modified page list writes the data out in clusters to secondary memory first before it can be reread

## replacement policy and cache sizes

in reality memory is read to cache in blocks and so if a page needs to be replaced you might have to swap out the entire block

## resident set management

resident set (the part of a process in main memory)

the os must decide how many pages to bring into main memory

### fixed allocation resident size

### variable allocation resident size

### replacement scope

local

global
