# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 3

Interrupts - interrupt the normal sequencing of the processor

Provided to improve processor utilization

Different types of interrupts

- Program
    - Generated by some condition during instruction execution like division by zero 

- Timer
    - Allows the operating system to perform certain functions on a regular basis

- I/O
    - Generated by an I/O controller to signal normal completion of an operation or to signal errors

- Hardware failure<br></br>

Transfer of control via interrupts

Instruction ccyle with interrupts
start -> fetch instruction -> execute instruction -> check for interrupts<br></br>

Multiple interrupts

- Disable interrupts while an interrupt is being handled
- Use a priority scheme for nested interrupts (new interrupt must be a higher priority for it to interrupt the interrupt)
