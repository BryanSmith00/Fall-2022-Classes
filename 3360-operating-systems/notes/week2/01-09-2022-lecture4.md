## Memory hierarchy

Principal of locality of words - assumes the order of instruction executions is sequential

When the instruction you need is in slower level of memory, go to that level and fetch the block of memory containing the needed instruction into the higher level memory. 

Operates on the probability that the next instruction you need is in the block you just fetched

Average access time = T1 * Hit ratio + (T2 + T1) * miss ratio

T1 is access time of fastest level of memory, T2 is the access time of the second fastest level of memory

Mis ratio = 1 - hit ratio<br></br>

## Cache memory

- Invisible to the OS (hardware level)
- Interacts with memory management hardware
- processor must access memory at least once per instruction cycle
- processor execution is limited by memory cycle time
- exploit the principle of locality with small fast memory

Cache principles
- contains a copy of a portion of main memoryu
- processor first checks cache
- if not found a block of memory is read into cache (principle of locality)<br></br>

## Cache/Main memory structure

Main memory - made up of blocks each has k words

Cache - each entry (location) is a block<br></br>

## Cache Design

Mapping function - Determines which cache location the block will occupy

Replacement algorithm - Least recently used (LRU) algorithm
- replace a block that has been in the cache the longest with no references to it
- You have to timestamp the blocks most recently accessed time

Write policy - Dictates when the memory write operations take place
- Can occur every time the block is updated
- can occur when a block is replaced 

## I/O

### Programmed I/O
- The processor periodically checks the status of the IO module until it is complete
- Bad performance

### Interrupt-Driven I/O
- IO can interrupt the processor when it finished the operation
- Downside: processor has to handle all the data transferring

### Direct memory access (DMA)
- When the processor wishes to read or write data it issues a command to the DMA module
- More efficient than interrupt-driven or programmed IO

## Symmetric multiprocessors (SMP)

two or more similar processors of comparable capability
- Share the same buss and memory
- Processors share access to IO devices
- All processors can perform the same functions

## Multicore computer

Combines two or more processors (cores) on a single piece of silicon (die)

Each core consists of all of the components of an independent processor

Each core has its own l1 and l2 cache but l3 is shared between the cores<br></br>
