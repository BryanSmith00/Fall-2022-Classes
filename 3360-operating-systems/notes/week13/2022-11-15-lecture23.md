# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 23 uniprocessor filtering contd

turn around time / service time

- closer to 1 is better (didnt wait)

preemptive or nonpreemptive (once a process enters the processor it does not leave until it is finished or blocked no interrupts)

## uniprocessor filtering algorithms

### first come first serve

nonpreemptive

only cares about arrival time and wait time for the system

### round robin

preemptive version of first come first serve, maximum time a process can be in the processor (quantum) before being sent around again

### shortest process next (spn)

nonpremptive
overhead based on estimating process time needed
process with the shortest service time is the one executed first

### shortest remaining time (srt)

preemptive version of spn
scheduler always chooses the process that had the shortest expected remaining process time
everytime a process arrives compare it against the process being executed, if it is smaller, preempt it
only need to check for preemption when a new process arrives

### highest response ratio next (hrrn)

chooses the next process with the greatest response ratio
ratio = time spent waiting + expected service time / expected service time

### fair-share scheduling

scheduling decisions based on the process sets
each user is assigned a share of the processor
objective is to monitor usage and give fewer resources to users who have had more than their fair share
