# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 16 - mutual exclusion contd

mutex semaphore - binary semaphore initialized at 1

## message passing - when processes interact two requirements must be met

synchronization

- to enforce mutual exlusion

communication

- to exchange information

### synchronization

send - non blocking

receive - blocking

to solve problems with nonblocking send, put the value to be sent into a buffer until the send is complete

### addressing

direct addressing

indirect addressing - better for sending messages (ports)

### mutual exclusion

everything between send() and receive() is a critical section

## readers/writers problem

a data area is shared among many processes, some processes only read the data some only write

conditions that must be satisfied

1. any number of readers can simultaneously read the file
2. only one writer at a time may write to the file
3. if a writer is writing the file no reader may read it

can solve the problem by giving either readers or writers priority

## chapter 6 concurrency: deadlock and starvation

there is no efficient solution to deadlock

ostrich algorithm - strategy of ignoring potential problems on the basis that they may be exceedingly rare (blue screen of death)

### resource categories

reusable - can be safely used by one process at a time and is not depleted

consumable - can be destroyed

- interrupts, signals, messages

Requesting resources in the opposite order of another process will result in a deadlock

blocking receives can also cause deadlocks

### methods to handle deadlocks

detection

prevention

avoidance
