# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 17 - deadlocks contd

do not send strings or vectors, or anything with dynamic memory size, send a dynamic array of characters

(code from class sending a name string)

## deadlock detection, prevention, and avoidance

mutual exclusion - only one process may use a critical resource at a time

hold and wait - a process may hold allocated resources while awaiting others

no pre-emption - no resource can be removed from a process holding it

circular wait - a closed chain of processes

### prevention

require that a process requests all resources at once

no preemption - if a process is holding resources it is denied new resources until it finishes

### avoidance

dynamically decide if a current resource allocation request will result in a deadlock

requires knowledge of future requests

#### resource allocation denial (banker's algorithm)

state - current allocation of resources to processes

safe state - there is at least one sequence of resource allocation that does not result in a deadlock

unsafe state - not safe

claim matrix C - per process total requests of resources

allocation matrix A - which resources are currently allocated to which processes

resource vector R - how many resources of each type are available

available vector V - how many of each resource are still avaliable for request

##### banker setup

1. check if intial request state is valid (each row of claim matrix requests less than the resource vector R)
2. allocation matrix should be less than or equal member wise to claim matrix
3. calculate C-A
4. calculate available vector V by summing each column in the allocation matrix and subtracting from resource vector R

##### algorithm steps

1. select the first row in C-A that is less than vector V (memberwise)
2. release all of that processes resources back to V (completed process)
3. update C, update A, update C-A, update V to indicate process completion (all zeros)
4. repeat
5. if all processes cannot be completed then there is a deadlock

### deadlock detection

1. mark each process that has a row in the allocation matrix of all zeros (no resources allocated means not part of a deadlock)
2. intialize a temporary vector W equal to the avaliable vector (allocation vector)
3. find an index i in the request matrix such that the process i is currently less than or equal to W. if no such i is found terminate the algorithm
4. if such a row is found mark process i and add the corresponding row of the allocation matrix to W

#### recovery strategies

abort all deadlocked processes either all at once or sequentially
