# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 15

## Producer/consumer problem

producer puts all produced items into an infinite buffer

consumer consumes items from buffer, cannot consume an item that doesnt exist

real life has limited size buffers so you must manage them

## implementation of semaphores

wait and signal must be atomic

## monitors

programming language construc that provides equivalent functionality to that of semaphores and is easier to control (java, not cpp)

### synchronization

achieved by condition variables that are contained within the monitor and accessible only within the monitor

condition variables are operated on by two functions

- cwait(c) suspend execution of the calling process on condition c
- csignal(c) resume execution of some blocked process after a cwait on the same condition
