## Peterson's Algorithm

solution for the principle of mutual exclusion.

only one process should be allowed to access a shared resouce at a given time

each process uses a flag to signal if it wants to enter the critical section of the code and a global turn counter

``` cpp
bool flag[2] = {false, false};
int turn;
```

``` cpp
//Process 0
flag[0] = true;
turn = 1;
while (flag[1] == true && turn == 1)
{
    // busy wait
}
// critical section
// ...
// end of critical section
flag[0] = false;
```

``` cpp
// Process 1
flag[1] = true;
turn = 0;
while (flag[0] == true && turn == 0)
{
    // busy wait
}
// critical section
// ...
// end of critical section
flag[1] = false;
```

guarantees mutual exclusion by ensuring the other process is not in the critical section and that it is the correct turn before entering

### Hardware level mutual exclusion

disable interrupts (uniprocessor system)

special machine instructions

compare&swap (compare and exchange)

- reads a value and changes a value without being interrupted
- still uses busy-waiting (bad)

## Common concurrency mechanisms

semaphores - a positive integer value used for signaling among proceses, only 3 atomic operations. Intialize, decrement (wait), increment (signal). When the value tries to go below 0 it blocks the process

binary semaphore - semaphore that only takes the value of 0 or 1

mutex - similar to binary semaphore but the process that locks the mutex (sets value to 0) must be the one to unlock it (set value to 1). always initialized to 1

condition variable - data type used to block a process or thread until a particular condition is true

monitor - language construct that encapsulates variables, access procedures, and itnizialiation code within an abstract data type. The monitor's variale may only be accessed via its access procedures and only one process can be accessing it at a time. Has a queue of processes waiting to access

event flags - a memory word used as a synchronization mechanism

mailboxes -

spinwait -

### strong/weak semaphores

strong semaphore

- blocked processes are accessed in a FIFO queue

weak semaphore

- blocked processes can be removed from the queue in any order

everything between a semaphore wait and signal is a critical section

semaphorwait()
//critical section
semaphorsignal()
