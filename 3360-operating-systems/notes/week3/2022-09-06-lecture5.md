# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 5

Kernals

### Serial processing
one process or program in memory at a time (old)

## Batch processing
- Uses a program monitor to execute programs, users can no longer acess directly the processor

### Hardware features 

memory protection for monitor
- While a program is running it may not access memory used by the monitor

timer - prevents program from monopolizing processor time

privilaged instructions - user mode, kernal mode

processor alternates between executing user programs and the monitor

Sacrifices 
- Some memory and processor time must be allocated to the monitor
- complexity

overall batch processing is a big improvement over serial processing

## uniprogramming

A single process is being executed at a time until it reaches an IO instruction it waits for the IO

## multiprogramming
- Multitasking

when one job is waiting for IO the processor switches to another process to maximize processor utilization

## Time-sharing systems

can be used to handle multiple interactive jobs

processor time is shared among multiple users

Dont want to maximize processor utilization because it might cause slow access for other users

## Real-time transaction systems

## causes of errors

improper synchronization

nondeterminate program operation

failed mutual exclusion
- more than one process tries to make use of a shared resource

deadlocks
- proceses can get hung up waiting for each other

## Process management

data

program (code)

context (process control block)

## memory management

Five principles
- process isolation
- automatic allocation
- support of modular programming
- protection and access control
- long term storage

### virtual memory

divided into pages 

## microkernal architecture

only put the bare minimum in memory and the rest is modules you can load as needed

address spaces

interprocess communication

basic scheduling

## multithreading

process running an application is divided into threads that can run concurrently

process
- collection of one or more threads with associated system resources

thread
- dispatchable unit of work
- includes a processor context and its own data to enable subroutine branching
