# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 13

reference cannot be assigned a value of null, pointers can

if you need to check for null, pass with a pointer, otherwise use reference

typical client-server model

send_req(args);

                rcv_req(&args);

                process(args, &results);

                send_reply(results);

rcv_reply(&results);

## Remote procedure calls

a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm

client and server processes do not share the same address space

must handle partial failures

no shared address spaces means no global variables and no passing by reference

## Concurrency

atomic operation - operation that cannot be interrupted

critical section - a section of code within a process that requres access to shared resources and that must not be executed while another process is in a corresponding section of code

deadlock - a situation in which two or more processes are unable to procced becuase each is waiting for one of the others to do something

livelock - two or more processes continuously change their states in response to changes in other processes without doing any useful work

mutual exclusion - when one process is in a critical section that accesses shared resources, no other process may be in a critical section that accesses any of those shared resources

race condition - multiple threads or processes read and write a shared data item and the final result depends on the relative timing of their execution

### mutual exclusion requirements

must be enforced

a process that halts must do so without interfering with other processes

no deadlock or starvation

a process must not be denied access to a critical section when no other process is using it

no assumption about speed

a process should only remain in a critical section for as little time as possible
