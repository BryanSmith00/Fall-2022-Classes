# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 8

Suspended processes

Swapping 

involves moving part or all of a process from main memory to disk

Blocked state - in memory but waiting for IO

## Suspended processes

Not available for immediate execution

The process may or may not be waiting for an event


## IO tables

Used by the OS to manage the IO devices


## File tables

provide information about existance of files, current status, 


## File permission in unix
owner (RWX) - group (RW-) - all other users (RW-)

## Process tables

must be maintained to manage processes

There must be some reference to memory, IO, and files

the tables are subject to memory management

## Process control structures

process location

process attributes
- user registers
- control and status registers


## Process image

user data

user program

stack 

process control block
- PID
- PPID
- User ID
- State


## Process identification

each process is assigned a unique numeric identifier


## processor state information

processor has a register for flags - need to capture the state during interrupts for returning to a process

## Control block

Scheduling and state information
- process state
- priority
- scheduling related information
- events that the process is waiting on

data structuring
- processes can be linked together using data structures

interprocess communication
- various flags signals and messages may be associates with communications between different processes

process privilage

memory management

resource ownership and utilization

## Modes of execution

User mode

System mode

## Process creation

assigns unique process identifier

allocates space for the process

...

## Process switching 

Interrupt
- external cause, not the program

trap
- An error or exception internally to the process

supervisor call


# Chapter 4 Threads

Processes and threads

Resource ownership

Scheduling/Execution


## Threads

Lightweight processes

Communicate without needing to use operating system

Benefits of threads
- Takes less time to create a new thread than a process
- Less time to terminate a thread
- Switching between threads is faster than processes
- Threads enhance communication between programs



### User level threads

all management is done by the application

the kernel is not aware of the existence of the threads



### Kernal level threads

thread management is done by the kernel none by the application

threads are created as user level so to switch to kernel level you must mode switch which incurs a cost overhead
