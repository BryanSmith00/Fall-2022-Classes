_exit(0); - terminates a process

fork() - Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. A child process uses the same pc(program counter), same CPU registers, same open files which use in the parent process.

Any time you call fork() you need to call wait(nullptr)
- Makes sure the parent process waits for all children to terminate before terminating itself

Processes can either be new, ready, running, blocked, or suspended
