# 3360 Operating Systems Lecture 11

Shared memory (Unix)

creates a region of memory that multiple processes can access

shmget - allocates a System V shared memory segment

shmdt(shm_ptr)

```c++
key_t key = 1234;
int *x;
int shmid;
shmid=shmget(key, sizeof(int), IPC_CREAT | 0666);
x = (int*) shmat(shmid,0,0);
*x = 0;
if((pid.fork())==0)
```

## Message passing

send()
recieve()

a blocking recieve does not return until a message has been recieved

non-blocking primitive or send returns as soon as the message has been accepted for delivery by the OS

- assumes that the OS can store the message in a buffer

simulating a blocking send with a non-blocking primitive by waiting for ACK

## Standard (what is best to use)

indirect naming

non-blocking sends

blocking recieves

## buffering

non-blocking primitves require buffering to let OS store messages that have been sent but not received yet

## network quality of service

---

### positive acknowledgement

destination process sends an ACK for every message that was correctly delivered

- damaged messages are ignored

sender resends any message that has not been acknowledged within a fixed time frame

### Virtual circuits

messages are guaranteed to arrive in sequence with no missing pieces (FTP HTTP)

### Datagrams

(UDP)

### streams

like virtual circuits

do not preserve message boundries

- reciever sees a seamless stream of bytes

TCP

heavy

reliable
