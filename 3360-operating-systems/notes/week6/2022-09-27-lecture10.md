Went over the exam questions

Roasting the class for not knowing pointers

## Interprocess communication

### Pipes

Create a pipe: system call pipe()

 #include <unistd.h>

Create a unidirectional communication buffer with two file descriptors fd[0] for read fd[1] for write

Data writeen and read on a first in first out basis. No external or permanent name, and can only be accessed through two file descriptors

The pipe can only be used by the process that created it and it descendents

close(fd) - closes a file descriptor

dup(newfd) and dup2(newfd, oldfd) - duplicate file descriptors

read(fd[0], readbuffer, sizeof(readbuffer))

write(fd[1], "text", number of bytes to write())

- call pipe before calling fork() for so the descriptor table is duplicated with the new pipe

simple, efficient, flexible. However you cannot open an already exisitng pipe and it is impossible for two processes to share a pipe if they are not part of a parent child relationship
